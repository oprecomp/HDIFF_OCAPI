# HDIFF_OCAPI
OpenCAPI FPGA accelerator for High Order Stencils (HOL)


* This repository includes the implementation of an FPGA accelerator for a High Order Stencil (HOL), specifically the Horizontal Diffusion  (HDIFF) from [COSMO whether model](http://www.cosmo-model.org/).
* The accelerator has been implemented using the [OC-Accel Transprecision Framework](https://github.com/oprecomp/oc-accel-tp).
* C code computes HDIFF by moving data from the CPU host memory to FPGA over OCAPI
* There is an option to have multiple parallel accelerators. We do procession in ROW and COLUMN while the DEPTH remains constant.
